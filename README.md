# Unclosed Nested Element in HTML
This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in HTML: a missing closing tag for a nested element. This can lead to unexpected layout issues and affect the overall rendering of the page.
The `bug.html` file shows the HTML with the error. The `bugSolution.html` file provides the corrected HTML.

## How to Reproduce

1. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
2. Observe the unexpected layout or rendering behavior due to the missing closing tag.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that all opened tags are properly closed in the correct order. The `bugSolution.html` file shows the corrected HTML with the closing tag added.
